## User Experience (UX)

This website is to have users enjoy themselves whilst testing their Star Wars knowledge using a fun quiz game to do so.

There is clear and simple intuitive buttons as guidance to help the user along their way, such as "Begin The Trials" start button, multiple choice questions to pick from and also "Next" & "Finish" buttons for the game. The results modal has the "Close" & "Play Again" buttons also. 

To help inspire the user and bring them into the Star Wars universe for their experience, I have used familiar colours and fonts as well as an animated space background to really help immerse the user.

## Features

* This website is targeting people who interested in getting a bespoke kitchen in their home.
* The user can view all galleries and things to consider, to help them make choices towards their new kitchen design.
* They can contact us with any queries or to make any bookings by navigating to the 'Contact Us' page and filling out the form. 
* Responsive on all device sizes.

### Existing Features

* Navigation bar
    * It is featured and fixed on all seperate pages.
    * This has been reduced down and been placed in the center to flow with the layout of the rest of the page.
    * I have used the same "El Messiri" font for this to compliment the logo as well as standing out against the majority "Exo" font that has been used throughout the site. 
    * It contains a dropdown menu for the kitchen related items for ease of use and user expreience.
    * I have used the same colour co-ordination with teal as the highlighted "active" page, whilst having the mouse hover turn the text to the teal colour; but in the dropdown menus a background colour of onyx will also appear. This is to make the user aware of what page they are on and also actively see what page they are potentially going to next when hovering over it. This hover change does not work on the page currently active.
    * I removed the navbar toggler and navigation bar when viewed on a smaller screen and put in a sidebar navigation for this function.
    * Includes links to the logo, home page, gallery, and sign-up page.
    * It is identical in design across the pages.
    * Allows easy navigation from page to page without having to revert back to the previous page via the "back" button.

    ![Navigation Bar](assets/images/navbar.png)

* Sidebar navigation 
    * The sidebar was used to tidy the screen up and input to increase user experience when used on smaller screens. 
    * It has all the same features and colourings as the navigation bar, but it instead has a toggler situated in the top right corner. When activated, the sidebar slides in from the right hand side of the screen and presents the logo in vertical wording on the left hand side.
    * The navigation menu has the same features as the navigation bar, but is centered and in vertical format.
    * There is a "X" close button situated on the right hand side of the logo text; you can also click anywhere else on the screen to close.

    ![Sidebar](assets/images/sidebar.png)


* Logo
    * I created something modern that stood out but was not to loud.
    * I used the "EL Messiri" font for this, which seemed a nice fit and made it stand out against the main "Exo" font that I used for the majority of the site.
    * The colours I used for this included a teal colour, which is the main colour I used for accenting the page, along with the subtle onyx.
    * These colours are used throughout the site for recognition and user comfort.
    * It has been reduced when on smaller screen sizes, along with being situated on the left with no slogan as to not make the screen too cluttered for user experience. This will reduce down to vertical wording it on very small screens, similar to side bar layout.
    * The wording has been place vertically when used in the sidebar navigation system, which uses the highlighted HKD well.
    * It has a minaimalistic attractive feel to it.

## Features Left to Implement

* The colouring was important to me; I wanted to emphasise the first letters of each word that can later shortened to HKD and possibly be used to create and emblem for the company. I envisioned this emblem as the capitalised letters being verticaly staggered in a step-like fashion.
* Adds radio buttons to the form to highlight what type of kitchen the user is interested in.
* Updated gallery with additional images.
* Videos of previous projects.
* Reduces the size of images to make gallery load times better.
* After having different users test and give feedback, I would like to stop the 'kitchens' navtext in the sidebar from moving to the left when activated as one user bought this up and stated it would be prefered for it to stay central.

## Design

 * Colour Scheme
    * Primary colours used on the website: ![Color Scheme](/assets/images/colour-scheme-hkd.png)

 * Typography
    * 'Exo' font is the main font used throughout the site with sans-serif as its fallback font, in case 'Exo' doesn't import for any reason.
    * The main logo, navbar & sidebar use the 'El Messiri' font with the back up of sans serif in case of any importing issues.
    * We also have the 'Dancing Script' font for the page headings with a back up of sans serif in case of any importing issues.

 * Wireframes
    * Figma: Easy to create, uses and shares detailed images whilst also effective.
    * Please find my wireframes here: [Figma: HKD Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/fupdLpMx3Fb1vqw2rvBQ2N/PM1-Hunter-Kitchen-Design?type=design&t=mSfuEJTOu1VWCTwQ-6)

## Bug fixes 

* At first, the navigation was situated on the left with a larger brand logo as the main home navigation and a toggler on the right when in a smaller screen. 

* I removed the brand logo as it was not visually clean and I had trouble moving it along with the other nevigation text with Bootstraps design. 

* The navbar toggler was stuck at at the same height as the navbar, which is situated under the logo text. This was not visually desireable, this was then replaced with the sidebar toggler and then situated in line with the logo on the top right of the screen, this also came with its own issues.

* The issue I ran into with the sidebar and toggler was that with Bootstraps design, it was causing a column of whitespace down the right side of all pages. I overcame this by finding out what Bootstrap CSS classes were causing this and I finally found the issues and resolved them using my custom CSS.

* Social icon margins in footer were causing one of the icons to move beneath the others when reducing the screen size. I experimented with margin sizes to keep them inline throughout.

* ARIA labels for screen readers amended for accessibility once tested.

* Meta descriptions were added to improve accessibility for screen readers.

* Accent colours were altered slightly to help with colour ratios, helping with accessibility issues after testing - mainly with footer. In the end, I brightened the accent colours and made the background darker to help them stand out.
